INT. BALTIMORE ROWHOUSE - NIGHT

A Hillary Clinton poster on the wall. Suddenly perforated with a hole as if being shot from a gun. More ticks of a BB gun. Shots right through her forehead.

A podcast playing in the background. Stavvy Halkias kinda vibe. Podcasters.

PETER, 39, pulls down the Hillary poster, revealing a foam backdrop on a door. Opens the door. Camera stays fixed. He paces up the space and comes into view.

EXT. STREET - DAY

PETER in a manual Jetta. He's driving delivery.

Podcast continues.

PODCASTER
So this guy, right, he's like "I'm not racist, I'm just asking questions" and I'm like, dude, you're literally asking if black people can swim.

PETER reaches into the DoorDash order and eats a fry. Cruises through a Baltimore intersection. Eats another fry. Then one more.

PODCASTER
And then he goes "well, statistically speaking..." and I'm like, bro, you're just racist. Just own it.

Phone rings and interrupts podcast. The name on the phone says SAM.

PETER picks up.

PETER
Yo.

SAM (V.O.)
What are you doing?

PETER pulls up to a red light. He looks out the window. Baltimore hood. He's scrolling reels on his phone.

PETER
Working.

SAM (V.O.)
No you're not. Are you hungry?

PETER
(inhales, some trauma there)
Yeah.

SAM
Let's get food.

PETER
Okay.

SAM
Like now.

PETER
Ok.

SAM
Let's go to Mike's.

PETER
Ok.

SAM
See you there.

PETER
Ok.

They hang up.

PETER sees some weird shit going down on the side of the road. Sees a guy hitching a ride. He drives by, not picking him up. Then he bangs it over and stops and puts his 4-ways on. The guy hurries up and gets in. Dude seems kind of military and hood at the same time. Tactical bags.

GUY
Thanks a lot man. I'll pay you. I'm tryin' to make it to Penn Station.

PETER
No problem.

Silence between them. Driving on North Ave.

GUY
How long you been in Baltimore?

PETER
20 years.

GUY
You're a local now.

PETER
You could say that. Where you from?

GUY
Alabama. I'm up here seeing my son. It was his wrestling match.

GUY pulls his phone and shows the pic. Clearly proud. He crushed it.

PETER
That's awesome man.

GUY
Yeah man. He's livin' with his mom. She takes care of her business.

PETER
I hear you.

GUY
You got a woman?

PETER's phone rings. It's SAM. PETER silences it.

PETER
I did.

GUY
Kids?

PETER just looks at him but no response. Open question to the audience? Does he or not? That's a hook.

INT. DINER - DAY

PETER walks in. SAM is sitting finishing the last bite of a BLT.

SAM
What the fuck bro.

PETER
Sorry.

SAM pays and they walk out the back through the kitchen.

SAM
(to a line cook)
Whatup Cory.

CORY
They get into a light but intense physical skirmish.

INT. CAR - DAY
