Centralia Pictures logo over black. SOUND of podcasters talking.

PODCASTER 1 (STAVVY) (V.O.)
We gotta get into FinTech.

PODCASTER 2 (NICK MULLEN) (V.O.)
"I'm revolutionizing banking" - you mean you're making an app that does what your bank already does but with a shittier interface? Awesome. Where can I download that?

PODCASTER 1 (STAVVY) (V.O.)
*laughter* What website can I download that from?

An image of Hillary Clinton is full bleed on the entire screen. An airsoft gunshot sound emits and a hole rips through the poster paper, creating a hole in her forehead.

PODCASTER 2 (NICK MULLEN) (V.O.)
*laughter* "We're based in SoHo" - you mean you live in Delaware and you made a clickbait ad campaign making it look like you live in Manhattan?

PODCASTER 1 (STAVVY) (V.O.)
"We're backed by top-tier VCs" - you mean your dad's friend gave you $50,000?

More holes appear, forming a Nazi swastika on her forehead.

PODCASTER 2 (NICK MULLEN) (V.O.)

PODCASTER 1 (STAVVY) (V.O.)
*laughter*

Reverse shot. PETER DENNEHY is looking down the barrel of a Glock 17 BB gun. He keeps firing until the gun is out. He racks the slide and looks into the barrel. He lowers the gun.

PODCASTER 2 (NICK MULLEN) (V.O.)
Do you even lift, bro? Check out this NFT.

PODCASTER 1 (STAVVY) (V.O.)
It's like just... some shitty JPEG.

PODCASTER 2 (NICK MULLEN) (V.O.)
It's a Geocities website just like... screencapped. You're like "this is worth 40,000 USD. Fiat." You can display it on your washing machine display screen.

PODCASTER 1 (STAVVY) (V.O.)
*laughter*

PODCASTER 2 (NICK MULLEN) (V.O.)
Cuck shit.

PODCASTER 1 (STAVVY) (V.O.)
