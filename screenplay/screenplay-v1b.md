PODCASTER 1 (STAVVY) (V.O.)
We gotta get into FinTech.

PODCASTER 2 (NICK MULLEN) (V.O.)
"I'm revolutionizing banking" - you mean you're making an app that does what your bank already does but with a shittier interface? Awesome. Where can I download that?

PODCASTER 1 (STAVVY) (V.O.)
*laughter* What website can I download that from?

An image of Hillary Clinton is full bleed on the entire screen. An airsoft gunshot sound emits and a hole rips through the poster paper, creating a hole in her forehead.

PODCASTER 2 (NICK MULLEN) (V.O.)
*laughter* "We're based in SoHo" - you mean you live in Delaware and you made a clickbait ad campaign making it look like you live in Manhattan?

PODCASTER 1 (STAVVY) (V.O.)
"We're backed by top-tier VCs" - you mean your dad's friend gave you $50,000?

More holes appear, forming a Nazi swastika on her forehead.

PODCASTER 2 (NICK MULLEN) (V.O.)
"It's decentralized, bro, you wouldn't understand."

PODCASTER 1 (STAVVY) (V.O.)
*laughter*

Reverse shot. PETER DENNEHY is looking down the barrel of a Glock 17 BB gun. He keeps firing until the gun is out. He racks the slide and looks into the barrel. He lowers the gun.

PODCASTER 2 (NICK MULLEN) (V.O.)
Do you even lift, bro? Check out this NFT.

PODCASTER 1 (STAVVY) (V.O.)
It's like just... some shitty JPEG.

PODCASTER 2 (NICK MULLEN) (V.O.)
It's a Geocities website just like... screencapped. You're like "this is worth 40,000 USD. Fiat." You can display it on your washing machine display screen.

PODCASTER 1 (STAVVY) (V.O.)
*laughter* Watch my NFT on your WiFi electric toothbrush while you wash up before blowing your... c suite boss.

PODCASTER 2 (NICK MULLEN) (V.O.)
Turns out it's just a room full of Indian dudes pretending to be one white crypto guy, he's like fully AI.

PODCASTER 1 (STAVVY) (V.O.)
*laughter* white meat puppet

PODCASTER 2 (NICK MULLEN) (V.O.)
They incubated him from someone's 23 and Me DNA.

PODCASTER 1 (STAVVY) (V.O.)
The whitest strain ever found.

PODCASTER 2 (NICK MULLEN) (V.O.)
He doesn't even have the like .00001% African. He's just like, formed from a piece of sperry topsider boat shoe leather that got struck by lightning in the primordial soup of what is now hartford connecticut. 

PODCASTER 1 (STAVVY) (V.O.)
*laughter*

PODCASTER 2 (NICK MULLEN) (V.O.)
He crawls out of this ancient ocean and he's like, "Hi, my name is Tanner Whitmore and I manifested my reality by being the first single-celled crypto fuckboy. Buy my PDF."

SCOTT PETERSON (V.O.)
Look, I'm not here to be another guru telling you to buy my course. I'm not going to sit here and pretend I have all the answers. But here's the thing - I've figured out something that most people never will. I'm not trying to sell you anything, I'm just sharing what worked for me. I'm documenting my journey, that's all. But if you want to join me on this path to financial freedom, there's a link below. I'm not saying it's guaranteed, but what if you could quit your job in 6 months? What if you could finally live the life you want? I'm just asking questions. This isn't about money, it's about building something real. We're not just subscribers, we're a movement. Join the community - link in bio. Because guys, this is just the beginning.
