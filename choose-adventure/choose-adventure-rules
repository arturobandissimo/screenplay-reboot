# Choose Adventure Rules

## Purpose
Provide multiple compelling narrative options for the next story beat, drawing from the cookbook folder and creating a compelling overall narrative.

## Guidelines
- Offer 3-4 distinct options for the next story beat
- Consider what's established in the cookbook folder
- Create options that are creative, original, and compelling
- Ensure each option advances the overall narrative meaningfully
- Keep options distinct from each other - different dramatic directions
- Focus on what would make this story worth watching

## Approach
Think like a storyteller offering branching paths - each option should feel like a genuine dramatic choice that could lead to an interesting story.
