WALTER SCREENWRITING TIPS - UCLA

BASIC PRINCIPLES
- Success is possible in this democratic enterprise
- You must be willing to give it the time
- Professional readers flip backward through scripts first
- Certain clues immediately reveal amateur vs professional work

PAGE COUNT AND LENGTH
- Screenplays run shorter now than they used to
- 99 pages isn't too skimpy
- 105 to 112 pages is the norm
- Comedy is sometimes shorter than drama
- Readers prefer shorter scripts
- Page count counts - readers feel the weight

TITLE PAGE
- Keep it minimal - title and writer's name only
- Add contact number or email on lower right
- Leave off Writers Guild Registration, date, draft number, copyright
- Remove "original screenplay by" and even "by"
- Title can be capped or underscored
- Writer's name should be lower case except first letters
- Any legal disclaimers look ridiculous
- Save ink and reader's time

PARENTHETICAL DIRECTIONS
- Avoid parenthetical directions completely
- No parentheses below character names
- Characters are what they say and do
- Characters exist without add-ons
- That's what directors are for
- Write the lines - that's tough enough
- Your job is "give great read" effortlessly

CHARACTER CREATION
- No stereotypes - make characters different from every movie seen
- Render everyone sympathetic, even villains
- Require characters to grow and develop throughout
- Example: Ratso in Midnight Cowboy transforms from thieving maggot to caring person

EXPOSITION AND VERBS
- Use active verbs, present tense
- Avoid the verb "to be" (am, are, is) if possible
- Story takes place in present - here and now
- Character "dances in moonlight" not "is dancing"
- Leave out words like "well," "you see," "look," "listen"
- Remove noises like "hmm," "um," "uh"
- Less language allows greater appreciation

NEW CHARACTERS
- No new main characters after Act 1
- No such thing as new Act 2 and Act 3 characters
- Must have ten ways to reveal information about "new" character
- Plant character references in Act 1
- Use clever exposition like flyer blowing away
- Audience must feel satisfied and surprised, not cheated

PROTAGONIST RESOLUTION
- Protagonist uses Deliberate Mental Cleverness
- Examples: Liar Liar, Indiana Jones
- Protagonist must have obstacles
- Make all settings different for protagonist
- Settings must offer something, not be mundane

RESTAURANT SCENES
- Avoid restaurant scenes unless integrated
- Integration is second most important component
- Put nothing on page that isn't integrated
- Character description: only gender and age (numerically)
- Hair color only relevant if part of story
- Example: Basic Instinct blond hair matters for climax

STORY STRUCTURE
- Beginning: part before you need nothing
- End: part after which you need nothing
- Too many start too early, end too late
- "I think" is before the beginning
- Screenplays model idealized human life
- Short beginnings, long middles, shorter endings

REPETITION
- Don't have characters tell us what they already told us
- Each scene must move story and character
- Don't let character tell another what audience already knows
- Example: Scent of a Woman plane scene repeats previous action

PERSONAL STORY
- Don't try to guess Hollywood trends
- Write your own personal story
- Most important component in saleable screenplay
- Write what you care about
- No trends - only good and bad scripts
- Good ones get you on radar

INTERNAL THOUGHTS
- Don't write "remembers" or "realizes"
- Only two kinds of information: what we see (description) and what we hear (dialogue)
- No internal character thoughts in exposition

INFORMATION CRITERIA
- Three questions for including information:
  1. Is there a purpose for including it?
  2. If so, is it a worthy purpose?
  3. If so, is this the best way to achieve that purpose?
- Worthy purpose affects, steers, expands, enhances story and character

TECHNICAL DETAILS
- Little things mean a lot - punctuation and spelling
- Avoid ellipses
- Write declarative English sentences
- Avoid funny punctuation
- Avoid long speeches in dialogue
- Don't underscore
- Don't number scenes (spec screenplay)
- Remove all "Continued" from software
- Get all little things done as well as big ones

CONFLICT
- Conflict is lifeblood of drama
- Where do you need conflict? Everywhere!
- Let your characters argue

PHONE CALLS
- Keep phone calls to minimum
- Come up with inventive ways to reveal exposition
- Don't rely on phone conversations

SCRIPT DEVELOPMENT
- Not all scripts are for selling - some are for drill
- Don't try to sell first script
- Make work stand up to reader scrutiny
- Probably needs couple of rewrites
- Then another polish
- Hire script consultant or trusted "kitchen cabinet"
- Last person to see should be agent/manager/producer, not first

PRINTING
- For spec script, photocopy one side of page
- Agencies copy on both sides for recycling
- Jury still out on submitting spec both sides

BIGGEST MISTAKES
- We write too much
- We show our work too soon
- Give yourself the time
- Writers don't fail in Hollywood - they give up
- If you give yourself time, you will succeed
