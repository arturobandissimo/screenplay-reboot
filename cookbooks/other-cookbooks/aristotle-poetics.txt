ARISTOTLE'S POETICS - The Recipe for Tragedy

The Six Elements of Drama:

1. PLOT (Mythos) - The arrangement of incidents. The soul of tragedy.
   - Must have beginning, middle, and end
   - Unity of action - one complete action
   - Reversal (peripeteia) and recognition (anagnorisis)
   - Catharsis through pity and fear

2. CHARACTER (Ethos) - The agents who perform the action.
   - Goodness - characters should be good
   - Appropriateness - characters should be appropriate to their type
   - Likeness - characters should be like real people
   - Consistency - characters should be consistent

3. THOUGHT (Dianoia) - The power of saying what is possible and pertinent.
   - What characters say to prove or disprove something
   - What they say to express a general truth

4. DICTION (Lexis) - The expression of meaning in words.
   - Clear and not mean
   - Appropriate to the character and situation

5. MELODY (Melos) - The musical element.
   - Chorus and other musical accompaniments

6. SPECTACLE (Opsis) - The production of visual effects.
   - The least artistic element
   - Depends more on the art of the stage machinist than the poet

The Three Unities:
- Unity of Action - One complete action
- Unity of Time - Action should take place within one revolution of the sun
- Unity of Place - Action should take place in one location

The Tragic Hero:
- Of noble birth and high position
- Has a tragic flaw (hamartia)
- Experiences a reversal of fortune
- Recognizes their error
- Arouses pity and fear in the audience

Catharsis:
The purging of pity and fear through the experience of these emotions in a controlled, artistic context.
