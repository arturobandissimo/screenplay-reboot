Scenes. (Coppola.) Each scene should be able to stand alone on its own as something. Each scene has:

SYNOPSIS - What happens.

CONTEXT - The reality of the world outside and how it affects the characters.

IMAGERY AND TONE - The texture and feeling of the scene. Details. Breathes life.

CORE - A word or two that forms the root of the scene. Hit the essence. Nail the core to each scene.

PITFALLS - What are the dangers. Cliches. Things that could fuck it up. It keeps the balance of the film. Traps you might fall into.
